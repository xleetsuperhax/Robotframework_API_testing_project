Project Title
    API Automation Framework using robotframework requests-library and jsonlibrary-library
Project Description
    This project aims to demo some of the basic features of API-test automation using the requests and jsonlibrary-libraries.
    The tests are divided into 2 separate suites, one for testing basic http calls and one

    The reason for performing basic API-testing is to gain a broader understanding over test automation as a whole
    with API-testing being one of the cornerstones of test atuomation.
